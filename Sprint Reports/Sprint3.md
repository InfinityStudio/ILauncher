# Sprint 3 Report

Product name : ILauncher,

Team name: LWPJ.

Date: Nov. 20

## Action to Stop doing

We stop developing all the thing in a single branch.

We stop forcing all the people to meet at the sametime for the long meeting.

## Action to start doing

Team starts to touch the problems of git commits and history. We start to develop in different branch by tasks. So, by using rebase and branch merging, we won't mess up the git history easily.

## Action to keep doing

We keep to have seperated small meeting for communicating and helping with each other. The tasks are still dispatched without much dependency so they could be finished "easily".
